"""
Specification Depth Metrics - Measures thoroughness beyond ratios.

Three metrics that distinguish comprehensive squad specs from minimal specs:
1. Requirement Volume Score (RVS): logarithmic count of distinct requirements
2. Coverage Density (CD): requirements per unique domain concept
3. Cross-Reference Index (CRI): internal requirement cross-references

These metrics reward specs that have MORE requirements, cover MORE concepts,
and have MORE interconnection between requirements.
